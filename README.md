# Silver Flag Operating System
Silverflag OS: The OS you actually enjoy using

# Features:
Things that we are going to work on including and morals we will follow when writing code for the OS:

1. Anything extra should be easy (trivially easy) to remove or disable, wether in the installer or after installation.
2. It should use purely open source software (were possible)
3. Should have amazing security by default
4. Should have an easy way to share a port with the internet using cloudflare
5. Should have a dedicated web panel you can access via localhost that is able to control the custom firewall and allow and dissalow traffic
6. zen kernel :)
7. XFCE4 in a similar layout to Windows for new users to easily comprehend.
8. The following apps should be installable in the installer (and of course easily opt out of)

* Discord
* qBitTorrent (or our fork)
* Firefox
* Steam (runtime/native)
* ProtonVPN
* Tor Browser
* Tor Daemon
* QEMU
* Lutris
* Wine64 (mostly valve's proton)
* JDownloader2
* Custom downloading solution
* neovim (better than vim :100:)
* Spotify (blockthespot?)
* Stremio
* Samba & FTP client (something other than FileZilla)
* Dedicated PiP menu (picture in picture for subway surfers)

*And more to come*

# Anti-features

1. Gnome, KDE or any other bloated DE
2. Closed Source Software
3. Spaghett (bad code)
4. Terminal only installer
5. Non-removable software we wrote or are adding to Arch
